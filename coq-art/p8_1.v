(* Exercise 8.1
Define the inductive property "last A a l" that is satisfied iff l
is a list of values of type A and a is the last element of l.
Define a function "last_fun: list A -> option A" that returns the last
element when it exists. Give a statement that describes the consistency
between these two definitions and prove it. Compare the difference in
conciseness and programming style for the two definitions.
