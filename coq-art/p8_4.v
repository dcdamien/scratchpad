(* Exercise 8.4
Define inductively the following binary relations on "list A":
 * the list l' is obtained from l by transposing two consecutive elements,
 * the list l' is obtained from l by applying the above operation
a finite number of times. Here we say thet l' is a permutation of l.
Show that the second relation is an equivalence relation.
